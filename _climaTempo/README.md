# About
This project was based on a challenge proposed by ClimaTempo as a technical assessment.

## The challenge
The users would like to know how the weather will be like for the next days using their handheld devices.

### Requirements
Based on the actual challenge, I decided to develop the platform using the files provided as database and not consuming it from an API.

### Technologies
The project has been developed using Node.js.
Detailed:
- Express
- EJS
- CSS 

### Database
Locales:
````
base/locals.json
````

Weather forecast:

base/weather.json
````
